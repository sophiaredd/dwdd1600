        <h2>Where to Start</h2>
        <p>Now before you jump into all the little details such as what flowers to use or what the food situation is going to be, there's a few big things you should consider first:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is the overall <a href="style.html#style">vibe/style</a> you envision for your wedding?</li>
                <li>What is your budget?</li>
                <li>What is your timeframe and what should you do first?</li>
            </ul>
        <p>These first few questions are going to help you have a direction for how you want your wedding to go, and in turn, will help you plan all of the little details. </p>
