        <p>When it comes to style, there's a few factors that go into it: color, decoration, location, and just the overall theme. We're going to break each of these things down for you so that you can best pick what your personal style is. If you're not entirely sure, one of the best places to look for inspiration is <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a>. Maybe take a gander around there and look at some wedding inspo, then come back!</p>
            <h2>Overall Vibes</h2>
            <p>Here, we're going to talk about a few of the different themes/vibes that have been popular in the wedding industry.</p>
            <!-- Attach pictures with each section when we learn how-->
            <dl>
            <dt><strong>Classical/Elegant</strong></dt>
                <dd>The Classical/Elegant wedding theme focuses on being very simple. There's not too much going on with decorations or set up. The idea is that less is more. This style has a very luxurious feeling. Lots of neutrals, maybe candles, and it's very timeless.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Garden/Cottage-core</strong></dt>
                <dd>Having a garden/cottage-core themed wedding really focuses on the florals. It's very whimsical, usually has more colors and more of a relaxed, garden-tea party type of feel. It has a very european kind of vibe and is very light-hearted and joyful. </dd>
            <dt><strong>Rustic/Country</strong></dt>
                <dd>The rustic/country style of wedding focuses on natural woods and the outdoors and incorporating that in any way they can with the decorations. It has this fun, wild, energetic vibe, and is very popular for the ones who love a little adventure. </dd>
            <dt><strong>Fairytale</strong></dt>
                <dd>The fairytale vibe is very magical. There's a feeling of wonder and romanticism that is portrayed with this type of style. And there's varying levels you can do adhere to it, whether you want it to be based on a fantastical land, or you just want a subtle hint of magic with some twinkling fairy lights. This is for all you romantics.</dd>  
            </dl>
            <p>Now, just because we have these grouped in a certain way, don't think that you are constrained to stick with it completely! So man people can find the different parts of each that they like and bundle it together to make their own, completely unique style. You can have an elegant garden themed wedding. Or a more rustic fairytale wedding. And that is the fun of wedding planning: creating something that uniquely embodies your own love story and vision. But it's very important to figure that out, becuase it can influence what colors and decoration and location that you pick! So with that being said, next up, we are going to look at colors and decorations. </p>
            
            <h2>Color and Decoration</h2>
            <p>Now that you have an idea of what you want your theme and style to be, the next thing you'll want to consider is the colors and decoration. What color do you want your bridesmaids/groomsmen in? Is there a main color and accent colors? Are your parents going to wear their own color? Are the decorations going to be color based or more object based? These are all questions to ask yourself so that you know what to look for when you're looking at vendors and things you'll need. Again, looking at Pinterest, Instagram, Google, etc. for color inspiration can help a lot. A great website that you can use to help you see if certain colors will look well together is  <a href="https://color.adobe.com/" target="_blank">Adobe Color</a>. You can even just pick you and your partner's favorite colors and go off of those! While color doesn't seem like it would be such a big deal, it's important to understand the psychology of how your surroundings can effect you and the environment. If you're having a classical/elegant type of wedding and you're using a bright purple and bright green, it's going to give off a very different type of feeling than if you were to do black and gold, say. Find weddings that have happened where you like their color scheme and gain inspiration from that! In the end though, it is ultimately up to you as a couple, and what will feel the most <em>authentic</em> to your love and personalities.</p>
            
            <h2>Location</h2>
            <p> Now, the last thing we'll cover with style for right now is the location. Location plays a huge role in your style and theme. If you're getting married in a barn with a dirt floor, but you're wanting something elegant and classy, the theme might get a little lost with the opposing styles. So it's very important to find a vendor that is in a location that fits with what you want your vibe to be! The best thing to do, is just go on Google and search for wedding vendors near you. Another option is doing a destination wedding! In that instance, location really is everything, especially if you're traveling far. Here are some things to consider when looking at vendors and locations:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>What is their pricing/packages and does it fit in your budget?</li>
                    <li>What amenities does this place include and what would you have to provide?</li>
                    <li>What have other people said about their experience with this venue and their expertise and communication?</li>
                </ol>
            <p>Obviously, there can and should be, more questions to consider, but those are some of the very important ones. Regardless of what you choose, make sure that it is something that excites you guys!</p>
