        <h1>Budget</h1>
            <p>Now one of the biggest, and probably most important, thing you want to figure out for your wedding is your budget. I know, not very exciting, if only we were all billionaires. But! Don't fret! We're here to help you get you your dream wedding while still styaing in the bounds of your budget. But first, here are the top things that people spend the most on at their wedding. While looking at these, figure out which is most important to you to have, and which ones you don't necessarily care to spend too much on. </p>
           
            
            <dl>
            <dt class="wedding-elements"><strong>Venue</strong></dt>
                <dd> Like it was stated when we talked about style, the venue is very important to consider to figure out what your theme of your wedding is going to be. These can be pretty pricey, depending on the different amenities they can offer, which includes, catering, setup/take-down, decorations, etc. You can save money by foregoing some of the amenities, or you can bundle it up if that is less expensive. Regardless, you have to do your research to figure out what works best for you!
                
                </dd>
            <dt class="wedding-elements"><strong>Photographer/Videographer</strong></dt>
                <dd> Having a good photographer/videographer can be so important! They are the ones responsible for documenting your perfect day, and you want to make sure that they do it justice so that you have these memories to look back on. Make sure that you look at different editing styles and packages of the photographer/videographer, because prices can vary. Especially if they are traveling out of state or have add-ons, etc. In our opinion, having, at least, a good photographer (you don't necessarily need a videographer) is something you do want to spend your money on, because you will always want to look back at these pictures and remember this day! But of course, it is up to you as a couple, and what you value most!
                
                </dd>
            <dt class="wedding-elements"><strong>Wedding dress/suit</strong></dt>
                <dd> Everybody wants to look and feel beautiful on their wedding day. So you have to consider your budget for your outfit. This includes the actual wedding dress, veil, suit, tie, tux (if wanted), shoes, and jewelry. This could even include hair and makeup! As you can tell, this can get very expensive, very fast. So figuring out what you really want to spend your money on, is so important. Some people have rented part of their wedding day attire, or even made their own! Do your research and find places that allow you to rent or have a good selection with reasonable prices so that you can really make sure that you can get what you want, to fit within your budget. 
                
                </dd>
            <dt class="wedding-elements"><strong>Catering</strong></dt>
                <dd> Depending on your ceremony ideas, lots of couples will provide food for either close family, or all guests. Catering can be expensive depending on who's catering and what the food is, and how many people there will be. Consider what is going to work best with the schedule of events. Will there be time for peple to have a sit down meal? Or will that just be for close family and friends? Maybe you can do just refreshments to keep people happy! Maybe you enlist your grandparents and aunts and uncles to help provide food! Whatever you decide, make sure that it's reasonable and fairly easy to organize!
                </dd>  
             <dt class="wedding-elements"><strong>Florals/Decorations</strong></dt>
                <dd>Last, but definitely not least, is the decorations and florals. The look of real flowers is absolutely whimsical, but definitely not needed. Nowadays, more and more people are DIY'ing their flowers from Hobby Lobby or finding alternate decorations such as candles or fruit. Something to also consider is, as mentioned above, that the venue can provide a lot of decoration themselves. For example, one of our clients got married in a greenhouse, so they really didn't need much decoration other than for the tables. Even then, the venue had centerpieces available for them to choose from. They just decided not to use those ones because it didn't fit their theme. But it's really so easy to find so many crafts and ideas on pinterest or google to create your own decorations. But if you really love the idea of having real flowers, and having someone else just take care of it, then budget that in! There is nothing wrong with having a professional make your space beautiful!
