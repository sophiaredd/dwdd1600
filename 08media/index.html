        <h1>Overview</h1>
            
        <p>First off, <strong>congratulations!</strong> You're engaged! Now starts the whirlwind journey of planning the best day of your life: your wedding! Now it may seem daunting at first, what with figuring out your budget, style, timeframe, etc. But luckily for you, we have an amazing team who has first hand experience in planning these things. So we've compiled a good list of tips and tricks that we have found to be most beneficial to have the most special day. With that being said, let's start the planning!</p>
            
        <h2>Where to Start</h2>
        <p>Now before you jump into all the little details such as what flowers to use or what the food situation is going to be, there's a few big things you should consider first:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is the overall <a href="style.html#style">vibe/style</a> you envision for your wedding?</li>
                <li>What is your budget?</li>
                <li>What is your timeframe and what should you do first?</li>
            </ul>
        <p>These first few questions are going to help you have a direction for how you want your wedding to go, and in turn, will help you plan all of the little details. </p>
